        <p>Hello! This website shows a little bit about me. I am from Huntsville, Alabama. I graduated at the University of North Alabama with a BBA in Computer Information Systems and Minoring in Sports and Entertainment Managment. I was also apart of the UNA NCAA Division 1 Cross Country team during my time there. My hobbies include running, music, sports, and video games. I am currently looking for roles in Software/Web Development.</p>
